# A-Professional-README-Generator

## Description
I built a professional-README-generator to make the process of creating README much easier. With this generator, it will save time and ensure consistency in documentation for every project. This project addresses issues of creating complex README files. This will provide the users a structured format, ensuring that important sections of the README would be satisfied. Through building this project, I learned how to use the import and export system, gained experience using libraries such as inquirer and file system.
